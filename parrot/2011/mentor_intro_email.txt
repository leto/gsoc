Howdy all,

Thank you all for volunteering to be Google Summer of Code mentors! If you have
not done it before, I think you will find it a rewarding experience, and if you
are a repeat customer, I hope this year will exceed past experiences.

I like to think of myself as the center of a whirlpool as the org admin for GSoC.
There are obviously so many things going on in each GSoC project that I cannot
hope to follow, which is the majority of the whirlpool. But I intervene strategically,
make sure everything is going smoothly, make suggestions for improvements, and
spin along to the next student, in a circle.

There are some good resources for mentors that I want to make sure you know about.
I highly suggest reading the GSoC Mentor Guide [0], especially since I helped write
it :) The History section is especially useful to read to get a feel for how GSoC
has evolved. This blog post about mentor antipatterns [1] is also a good overview.

Here are some of my suggestions for making the summer a success. Feel free to
pick and choose any of them. From experience, the more of these you do, the greater
the chance of a student successfully completing:

1) Exchange contact info with student (phone/email/skype/twitter/etc)
2) Actually talk and or video chat with student. Seeing a face, even once,
creates a more personal relationship. If video is not possible, audio is
the next best option.
3) Set up a time at least once a week where you have "office hours" and are
available for real-time conversation, i.e. IRC/chat/skype. 
4) Give your student positive encouragement, randomly. Tell them war stories of
yonder days when they are hitting a wall. It will boost their self-esteem. They
need to learn to fail better and fail faster.
5) Ask your student about their background, which editor they are using, which
OS, things like that, so you know where they are coming from. The more you know
about them, the better of a mentor you can be.

Ok, that is my song and dance for now. Please feel free to contact me whenever
you have a question. If it is not time-sensitive, email is best, but feel free
to call/text my number below for time-sensitive situations.

More emails will be forthcoming with details about the timeline. Just bond with
your students for now :)

May the code flow through you.

Duke
